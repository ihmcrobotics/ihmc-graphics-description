/**
 * Describes the job of a {@link YoGraphic}. When the user creates one, the {@link YoGraphic} is assumed 
 * to be writing in the {@link YoVariable}s.
 * When the graphic is created from {@link RemoteYoGraphicFactory}, it is assumed that the graphic is used as a
 * {@link RemoteYoGraphic} and thus does only read the {@link YoVariable}s.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Differentiating the {@link YoGraphic} according to their job allows to implement simple 
 * synchronization between a {@code WRITER} and a {@code READER} to ensure proper rendering.
